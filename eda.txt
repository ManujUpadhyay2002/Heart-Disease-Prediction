-> Data Clening Conclusion: 

    - There are 0 duplicate values.
    - change 'education' column dtype to 'int' and there is also some other columns to change to 'int'.
    - There are some null values in col. index = [2,4,5,9,12,13,14]    
    - Columns : 
        education          2.241888 %
        cigsPerDay         0.766962 %

-> Categorical Features:

    1. TenYearCHD:
        - Data is biased towards 'no' 
        - 84% 'no' & 16% 'yes'

    2. gender:
        - male has more 7% chance w.r.t female of having disease
        - we use 'one hot encoding' beacuse there is almost same probability for male and female. 

    3. currentSmoker: 
        - As per Data this column is not that much relevant beacuse there is 1% more chance that person is smoker & has disease
        - we can drop it.

    4. BPMeds:
        - data is highly biased towards person has not Blood Pressure.
        - probability of having disease is more than double when person has Blood Pressure.
        - so, if person has Blood Pressure than person has 33.06% chances that he/she has disease. 
        - here we use 'ordinal encoding' beacuse if person has Blood Pressure than he has high chances w.r.t person has not.
    
    5. prevalentStroke:
        - data is highly biased towards person has not Prevalent Stroke.
        - probability of having disease is more than triple when person has Prevalent Stroke.
        - so, if person has Prevalent Stroke than person has 44% chances that he/she has disease. 
        - here we use 'ordinal encoding' beacuse if person has Prevalent Stroke than he has high chances w.r.t person has not.
    
    6. prevalentHyp:
        - data is biased towards 'no'.
        - probability of having disease is more than double when person has Prevalent Hypertension.
        - here we use 'ordinal encoding' beacuse if person has Prevalent Hypertension than he has high chances w.r.t person has not.
    
    7. diabetes:
        - data is highly biased towards person has not Diabetes.
        - probability of having disease is more than double when person has Diabetes.
        - so, if person has Diabetes than person has 36.70% chances that he/she has disease. 
        - here we use 'ordinal encoding' beacuse if person has Diabetes than he has high chances 
        w.r.t person has not.
    
-> Continues Features:

    1. age:
        - here categorise data into two parts age '< 47' & '>= 47'.
        - after categorise data is biased.
        - now if age is greater than 47 than there is almost triple probability of having disease.
        - so we can use ordinal encoding for that. 
    
    2. education:
        - we use 'one hot encoding' beacuse there is almost same probability for all categorise.
    
    3. totChol:
        - there is 65 rows of outliers 
        - range : values>345(61) & values<125(4)
        - this outlier data is 1.53% of all over data.
        - we have to deal with it.
        - proof for outlier range : The disease, known as familial      
                                    hypercholesterolemia, affects about 1 
                                    in 500 people and can cause total cholesterol levels from 300 mg/dL to 600 mg/dL, as well as heart attacks early in life.
